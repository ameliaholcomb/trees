These images are taken from multiple perspectives (consecutively) around a single tree.
The images within a sample are intended to be interchangeable; multiple
images were taken for each location in case one turned out poorly.
There is no special correspondence between, eg, the first depth image of a sample
and the first RGB image of a sample.


PART 1: SAMPLES 21-23
These images are taken from three perspectives around a single tree.
Moving clockwise around the tree, no attempt was made to ensure uniform
distance between samples. The heights are approximately the same, but due to uneven ground
they may also be slightly different.
